# To Do

## High Priority Next
- [ ] Schedule confidential meeting with Atul to discuss ICLR submission and demo scope
- [ ] Get access to ICLR submission code repository (if available)
- [ ] Understand confidentiality constraints and what can be shown publicly
- [ ] Define specific demo scenario within 20-30 hour budget
- [ ] Create project timeline with weekly milestones

## This Week
- [ ] Review ICLR submission materials (CONFIDENTIAL)
- [ ] Understand ML model architecture and training requirements
- [ ] Identify pre-trained models or inference-only demo approach
- [ ] Document setup steps and any confidentiality considerations
- [ ] Time-box initial exploration (4-6 hours max)

## Later
- [ ] Build ML demo environment (focus on inference, avoid training)
- [ ] Create interactive demo showcasing model capabilities
- [ ] Generate compelling visualizations maintaining confidentiality
- [ ] Test demo reliability and prepare fallback scenarios
- [ ] Coordinate with NSF video production timeline

## Notes
- Time budget: 20-30 hours total
- **CONFIDENTIAL SUBMISSION** - maintain strict confidentiality
- Focus on model inference and visual demonstrations
- Consider pre-trained models to avoid extensive compute requirements
- Coordinate carefully with Atul on what can be shown publicly
