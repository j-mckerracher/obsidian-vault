## Context & Goals
- Purpose: Create a concise, runnable demo for Atul's ICLR submission (under review)
- Success criteria: Working demo that showcases key contributions within 20-30 hour budget

## Summary
Build an attractive and feasible demo for Atul's ICLR paper submission to be featured in the NSF site visit video.

## Goals
- Reproduce key results from the ICLR submission
- Create a compelling visual demonstration of the ML system
- Ensure demo runs reliably and showcases innovation
- Keep scope manageable within time budget
- Maintain confidentiality of unpublished work

## Context
- Why this matters: Showcases innovative ML research for NSF reviewers
- Dependencies: Access to code, datasets, and coordination with Atul
- Stakeholders: Atul (primary author), NSF reviewers, video production team
- **CONFIDENTIAL**: Paper is under review, do not share details externally

## Scope
- In: Core ML functionality, visual demonstration, basic performance metrics
- Out: Extensive training, new experiments, comprehensive evaluation

## Deliverables
- Working demo environment (containerized if possible)
- Demo script and walkthrough
- Sample datasets and test cases
- Visual assets for video production
- Model performance visualization or results

## Milestones
- [ ] Milestone 1: Environment setup and code reproduction — due: Oct 14, 2025
- [ ] Milestone 2: Demo scenario defined and working — due: Oct 21, 2025
- [ ] Milestone 3: Demo ready for video recording — due: Oct 28, 2025

## Timeline
- Time budget: 20-30 hours total
- Week 1: Environment setup and initial reproduction
- Week 2: Demo refinement and testing
- Week 3: Final preparation and coordination with video team

## Communication
- Initial meeting with Atul to understand submission and codebase
- Regular updates on progress and blockers
- Coordination with NSF video production timeline
- **Maintain confidentiality** in all communications

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Complex ML setup or training requirements
  - Mitigation: Use pre-trained models, focus on inference demo
- Risk: Code not readily available or documented
  - Mitigation: Direct collaboration with Atul, focus on concepts if needed
- Risk: Confidentiality breach
  - Mitigation: Limit access, avoid external sharing, focus on demo aspects only

## Notes
- **CONFIDENTIAL SUBMISSION** - Do not share outside team
- Focus on visual impact for video demonstration
- Consider ML model visualization or interactive elements
- Coordinate carefully with Atul on what can be shown publicly
