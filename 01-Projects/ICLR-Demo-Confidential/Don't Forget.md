# Don't Forget

## **⚠️ CONFIDENTIALITY CRITICAL ⚠️**
- **CONFIDENTIAL SUBMISSION** - Do not share outside immediate team
- **NO external publishing or sync** of project materials
- All discussions must maintain confidentiality of under-review work
- Only show publicly acceptable demonstration aspects

## Critical Constraints
- **Time budget: 20-30 hours maximum**
- Demo must be ready for NSF video recording by Oct 28, 2025
- **Maintain strict confidentiality** throughout development
- Focus on model capabilities, not sensitive training details

## Approvals Needed
- **Atul approval required** for all demo content and what can be shown publicly
- Confidentiality clearance for NSF demonstration
- Legal review of public presentation materials

## Key Requirements
- Demo must respect confidentiality while showcasing ML innovation
- Focus on inference and model behavior rather than architecture
- Use pre-trained models to avoid compute-intensive training
- Prepare interactive visualizations of model capabilities

## Important Contacts
- Atul (submission author - **primary and only technical contact**)
- Legal/compliance team for confidentiality guidance

## **CONFIDENTIALITY PROTOCOL**
- **Never share submission details externally**
- **No model architecture details without approval**
- **Secure handling of all project materials**
- **Focus on capabilities demo, not implementation details**
