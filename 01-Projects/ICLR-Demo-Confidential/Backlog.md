# Backlog

## Now
- [ ] Reproduce ML environment
- [ ] Define demo scenario (within confidentiality constraints)
- [ ] Access pre-trained models if available
- [ ] Test inference pipeline

## Next
- [ ] Build interactive ML demo interface
- [ ] Create compelling visualizations
- [ ] Test demo with various inputs
- [ ] Coordinate public presentation approach

## Later
- [ ] Package demo with appropriate security measures
- [ ] Document model capabilities publicly shareable
- [ ] Archive confidential materials securely

## Ideas
- [ ] Focus on model capabilities rather than specific architecture
- [ ] Interactive visualization of model behavior
- [ ] Real-time inference demonstration

## Blockers
- [ ] Confidentiality clearance for public demonstration
- [ ] Access to submission materials and trained models
- [ ] Compute resources for model inference
