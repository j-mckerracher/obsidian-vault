## 📂 Documentation Structure

### Core Status Documents
These are the most frequently updated files that track current state:

- **[[README]]** — Current status, next actions, recent context (AI agent entry point)
- **[[Status]]** — Detailed current status, stage progression, next actions
- **[[Plan]]** — Roadmap, milestones, tasks, risks
- **[[Experiments]]** — Canonical experiment tracker (all runs with results)
- **[[RESULTS_SUMMARY]]** — Executive summary for research reporting

### Quick Reference
- **[[Dont-Forget]]** — Critical reminders, preferred commands, common patterns
- **[[Backlog]]** — Future work items not yet prioritized

### Detailed Documentation Folders

## 🔄 Typical Workflow

### Intro
1. Read **[[README]]** — Get current status and context
2. Review **[[RESULTS_SUMMARY]]** — Understand key findings
3. Check **[[Status]]** — See detailed current state
4. Review **[[Plan]]** — Understand roadmap and milestones
5. Browse **[[Experiments]]** — See all experiment history

### For Continuing Work
1. Update **[[Status]]** after significant progress
2. Update **[[Plan]]** when milestones change
3. Update **[[Experiments]]** when runs complete
4. Add to **[[Work-Completed/Index]]** at end of session
5. Update **[[README]]** recent context section

## 📋 File Naming Conventions

All files and folders use hyphens instead of spaces:
- ✅ `Dont-Forget.md`
- ✅ `Work-Completed/`
- ❌ ~~`Don't Forget.md`~~
- ❌ ~~`Work Completed/`~~

Experiment files follow the pattern:
- `expt-YYYYMMDD-{stage}-{type}.md`
- Example: `expt-20251025-e2-prod-3k.md`
