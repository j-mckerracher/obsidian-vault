# Phase 2 Progress Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-25  
**Status**: 🟨 In Progress (3 of 5 core tasks completed; 2 deferred)  
**Commit**: b6b511b

## Completed Tasks ✅

### 1. Work Completed Daily Logs
- ✅ Created `Work Completed/2025-10/2025-10-25.md`
- Documented Phase 1 completion, tasks done, experiments touched
- Planned next-day activities and dependencies
- Established folder structure for future daily logs

### 2. Job-Submission-Commands Notes
- ✅ Created `Job-Submission-Commands/2025-10-25-expt-20251025-e2-prod-3k.md`
- Documented E2 production 3k-episode job submissions
- Included exact SLURM commands for all 3 seeds
- Full metadata: resources, account, partition, QoS
- Status tracking and output locations

### 3. Plan.md Restructuring
- ✅ Added **Milestones table** (8 items, status tracking)
  - E1 Baseline: ✅ Done
  - E2 Validation: ✅ Done
  - E2 Production: ✅ Done (94.3%)
  - E3 PER: ✅ Parked
  - **64×64 Resolution Scaling**: 🔄 In Progress (awaiting results)
  - E4 N-step Returns: ⏸ Blocked (pending 64×64)
  - Documentation Phase 1: ✅ Done
  - Documentation Phase 2: 🔄 In Progress
- ✅ Added **Tasks by state** (In Progress, Backlog, Done)
- ✅ Added **Risks & Mitigation** table (5 risks identified)
- ✅ Updated **Next 3 Actions** with clear priorities

## Deferred Tasks (Pending 64×64 Results)

### 1. Legacy E1 Experiment Migration
- **Task**: Batch-migrate 23 legacy E1/early-E2 experiments from Experiments/ to Documents/Experiments/
- **Reasoning**: Lower priority; can proceed in parallel with active jobs
- **Timeline**: Post-64×64 results (2025-10-26)
- **Effort**: ~1-2 hours for batch template conversion

### 2. Cross-link Audit & Final Validation
- **Task**: Verify all wikilinks resolve; tag consistency; no stale timestamps
- **Reasoning**: Deferred to catch any new links added during active work
- **Timeline**: Post-Phase-2 (2025-10-26+)
- **Effort**: ~30 minutes

## Current State (2025-10-25 16:48 UTC)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Phase 1** (5 canonical expts) | ✅ Complete | Commit 37589f5 |
| **Phase 2 Job Notes** | 🟨 Partial | 1 of ~4 documented; others pending results |
| **Phase 2 Daily Logs** | 🟨 Started | 2025-10-25 entry created; 2025-10-26+ pending |
| **Phase 2 Plan Updates** | ✅ Complete | Milestones, risks, tasks all updated |
| **Phase 2 Legacy Migration** | ⏳ Deferred | Ready to start; waiting for 64×64 results |
| **64×64 Jobs** | 🔄 Queued | Submitted to Gilbreth; monitoring |

## Key Decisions

1. **Phase 2 is proceeding in parallel with active jobs** — No blocking on legacy consolidation
2. **Job notes will be created as jobs complete** — Document results in real-time
3. **Daily logs will track active experiments** — Provides context for next actions
4. **Legacy experiments deferrable** — Not on critical path; can complete after 64×64 validation

## Unresolved TODOs (Updated)

### Still Pending
- [ ] Batch-migrate 23 legacy E1 experiments (post-64×64 results)
- [ ] Create remaining Job-Submission-Commands notes (E2 confirm, E3 smoke, E3 sweep)
- [ ] Cross-link audit and validation
- [ ] Set up Obsidian dataview queries (post-Phase-2)
- [ ] Create KPI dashboard (post-Phase-2)

### Information Gaps
- [ ] Record actual job IDs from 64×64 runs
- [ ] Document 64×64 results in new experiment note (expt-20251025-e2-res64)
- [ ] Exact test_results.json aggregation methodology
- [ ] Training curve plot links

## Next Immediate Actions (2025-10-26)

1. **Monitor 64×64 jobs** 
   - Track progress: `squeue -j <job_id>`
   - Capture job IDs and update Job-Submission-Commands/2025-10-25-expt-20251025-e2-res64.md
   - Document results in new experiment note

2. **Create 2025-10-26 daily work log**
   - Record job completions and results
   - Plan follow-up actions based on performance

3. **Begin legacy experiment migration** (if no blocking issues)
   - Batch convert 23 experiments using template
   - Standardize naming to expt-YYYYMMDD-{stage}-{run-type}

## Statistics

| Metric | Phase 1 | Phase 2 (So Far) | Total |
|--------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| Files created | 9 | 2 | 11 |
| Files updated | 3 | 1 | 4 |
| Canonical experiments | 5 | 0 (legacy pending) | 5 (+ 23 legacy) |
| Job notes | 0 | 1 | 1 (of ~4 planned) |
| Daily logs | 0 | 1 | 1 (of many upcoming) |
| Wikilinks | 25+ | 5+ | 30+ |
| Commits | 1 | 1 | 2 |

## Rationale for Deferral

**Why defer legacy migration & audit to post-64×64?**
- Phase 1 captured current critical experiments with immediate value
- Active 64×64 jobs take priority for monitoring and documentation
- Legacy consolidation is lower-priority polish work
- Can document new results while migrating old ones in parallel
- Keeps Phase 2 focused on: (1) job documentation, (2) daily logs, (3) plan updates — all in flight

**Why this approach is low-risk:**
- No dependency on Phase 2 legacy migration for active work
- All Phase 1 functionality complete and committed
- Phase 2 structure (templates, naming conventions) established
- Can resume Phase 2 cleanup after 64×64 results arrive
