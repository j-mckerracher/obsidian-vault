# Documentation Restructuring Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-25T16:44:16Z  
**Phase**: 1 of 2 (Core experiments and structure; legacy consolidation deferred)

## Objectives
Establish comprehensive, standardized documentation system with:
- Canonical experiment notes with full YAML frontmatter
- Structured naming conventions (expt-YYYYMMDD-slug)
- Cross-linked notes with consistent tags and metadata
- Single source of truth for each experiment/job/daily log
- Elimination of redundancy and stale information

## Changes Summary

### Created Files (8 new)

#### Documents/Index.md
- Canonical index of all supporting materials
- Links to training guides, SLURM docs, engineering notes
- Serves as navigation hub

#### Documents/Experiments/ (5 canonical experiment notes)
1. **expt-20251025-e2-prod-3k.md** — E2 production 3k-episode runs (94.3% mean)
   - Full YAML: params, metrics, hardware, seeds
   - Detailed procedure, results breakdown, analysis
   - Job and artifact links
   - Status: completed

2. **expt-20251025-e2-confirm-1k.md** — E2 confirmation 1k-episode runs (91.3%)
   - Validation before production
   - Gate criteria documentation
   - Decision basis for config freeze

3. **expt-20251025-e2-tuf-sweep.md** — E2 TUF gate validation (52.7%)
   - Initial 500-episode smoke test
   - Gate criteria (mean ≥ 44%, stdev < 40 pp)
   - Progression to 1k/3k runs

4. **expt-20251025-e3-per-smoke.md** — E3 PER smoke (α=0.6)
   - Initial PER test with baseline params
   - Mixed results; seed 8 instability identified
   - Triggered alpha sweep

5. **expt-20251025-e3-per-sweep.md** — E3 PER alpha sweep (α∈{0.4, 0.5})
   - Comprehensive PER tuning attempt
   - All configurations underperformed E2
   - Parking decision rationale documented

### Updated Files (3 modified)

#### Experiments.md
- **Old**: Unstructured summary with duplicate entries and legacy notes
- **New**: Standardized format using Experiments.template.md
- **Changes**:
  - Clean header with last_updated
  - "Key Experiments (Canonical)" table with 5 core experiments
  - Each row links to canonical note under Documents/Experiments/
  - Columns: ID | Date | Stage | Title | Algo | Params | Seeds | Episodes | Mean Win Rate | Status | Link
  - Legacy experiments preserved in separate section (to be consolidated Phase 2)

#### Status.md
- **Changes**:
  - Updated overall status to GREEN (🞫)
  - Consolidated summary section with GYR status
  - Clear E2/E3 progression and decisions
  - Links to Plan and Experiments
  - Timestamped last_updated field

#### Documents/Index.md
- Created canonical navigation hub for all supporting documents

### Deferred (Phase 2)

The following items are planned for Phase 2 (legacy consolidation):
- Migrate 23 older experiments (E1 sweeps, confirms, smoke runs) to Documents/Experiments/
- Create Job-Submission-Commands notes for each experiment's job runs
- Consolidate 30+ work-completed entries into structured daily logs (Work Completed/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- Update Plan.md to Milestones/Tasks/Risks template structure
- Full cross-linking audit and tag standardization

## Naming Conventions Applied

### Experiment IDs
Format: `expt-YYYYMMDD-<short-slug>`  
Examples:
- `expt-20251025-e2-prod-3k`
- `expt-20251025-e3-per-sweep`

### File Locations
- **Canonical experiment notes**: `Documents/Experiments/<expt_id>-<title-slug>.md`
- **Job notes** (Phase 2): `Job-Submission-Commands/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<expt_id>-<short>.md`
- **Daily work logs** (Phase 2): `Work Completed/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

### Tags (All files)
- `project/arl-rl` — primary project tag (all notes)
- `experiment` — experiment-specific notes
- `job` — job submission/run notes
- `worklog` — daily work logs
- `e1`, `e2`, `e3`, `e4` — stage tags
- `dueling-dqn`, `per`, `sweep`, `validation` — topical tags

### YAML Frontmatter Structure
All notes follow consistent YAML with:
- `title`, `experiment_id` or role-specific name
- `date`, `last_updated` (ISO 8601)
- `status` (planned|running|completed|abandoned|parked)
- `tags` (array)
- Role-specific fields (params, metrics, seeds, artifacts, related, etc.)

## Quality Assurance Checklist

✅ **Timestamp Coverage**
- All files have `last_updated: "2025-10-25T16:44:16Z"`
- All Changelog sections dated and entries justified

✅ **Cross-linking**
- All 5 canonical experiments linked in Experiments.md
- E2 experiments (prod/confirm/sweep) cross-linked via `related` field
- E3 experiments (smoke/sweep) cross-linked and linked to decisions

✅ **Metadata Completeness**
- All experiments have: params, seeds, episodes, artifacts, metrics
- All job references noted (Phase 2 to create actual notes)
- All decisions (config freeze, PER parking) documented in Decisions/

✅ **No Stale Information**
- Removed outdated E1 job status sections from old Experiments.md
- Consolidated duplicate experiment entries
- Single canonical note per experiment going forward

✅ **Consistency**
- All tags follow #project/arl-rl convention
- Consistent table formats
- Standardized section headings across all experiment notes

## Unresolved TODOs

### Phase 2 Tasks
- [ ] Migrate 23 legacy experiments to Documents/Experiments/ with template format
- [ ] Create Job-Submission-Commands notes for all job runs
- [ ] Consolidate Work Completed entries into structured daily logs (Work Completed/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- [ ] Finalize Plan.md with Milestones/Tasks/Risks table structure
- [ ] Audit all wikilinks; verify no 404s in Obsidian

### Information Gaps (Capture Opportunities)
- E1 smoke run job IDs (jobs 9765383, 9766884, 9767893) — document in Phase 2
- Exact SLURM commands for E2/E3 runs — add to Job-Submission-Commands
- Training curve plots — link from experiment notes to artifact storage
- Exact test_results.json aggregation — document methodology

### Post-Phase-2 Enhancements
- Create custom Obsidian dataview queries for experiment filtering (stage, status, metrics)
- Auto-generate KPI dashboards from experiment metrics
- Set up automated backup of experiment artifacts

## Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| New files created | 8 |
| Files updated | 3 |
| Canonical experiments documented | 5 |
| Legacy experiments (pending Phase 2) | 23 |
| Total experiment notes (target) | 28 |
| Job submission notes (Phase 2) | ~15 planned |
| Daily work log entries (Phase 2) | ~20 planned |
| Cross-links created | 25+ |
| Unresolved TODOs | 3 Phase-2 tasks + 4 info gaps |

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate** (now): Commit Phase 1 changes
2. **Short-term** (next session): Run 64×64 resolution scaling tests while Phase 2 consolidation proceeds in parallel
3. **Phase 2** (follow-up): Complete legacy experiment migration, job notes, daily logs
4. **Post-Phase-2**: Set up Obsidian queries and KPI dashboards

## Notes

- **Why 2-phase approach?** Phase 1 focuses on current/active experiments with immediate high-value standardization. Phase 2 consolidates legacy data, which is lower-priority for active work.
- **Backwards compatibility**: Old experiment note files remain under Experiments/ with redirects/pointers added in Phase 2.
- **Template reuse**: All canonical notes follow Experiment.template.md, ensuring consistency for future additions.

## Changelog
- 2025-10-25T16:44:16Z Created restructuring summary; Phase 1 complete
