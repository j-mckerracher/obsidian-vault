# 20251019_033706_E1_seed4 — Experiment Run

## Overview
- Run ID: 20251019_033706_E1_seed4
- Objective: Stage E1 smoke validation (short, backfill-friendly)
- Part: Algorithmic upgrade — E1 (Double DQN + LR scheduler)

## Metadata
- Date/Time (UTC): 2025-10-19T03:48:11.460274Z
- Resolution: 32×32
- Episodes (train): 300
- Test episodes: 5
- Seed(s): 4
- LR: 0.00005
- EPS_DECAY: 100000
- TARGET_UPDATE_FREQ: 300
- Batch size: 2
- Step multiplier: 32
- Artifacts path: /depot/sbagchi/data/josh/RL/FindAndDefeatZerglings/results_split_advanced/20251019_033706_E1_seed4
- Aggregation CSV: /depot/sbagchi/data/josh/RL/FindAndDefeatZerglings/results_split_advanced/e1_results.csv
- SLURM: a30 / sbagchi / standby, 1h, 1×GPU, 2 CPU, 20G mem
- Job ID: 9765383

## Results
- 5-episode test win rate: 80.0%
- Avg reward: 2.0
- CSV entry:
  - timestamp_utc: 2025-10-19T03:48:11.460274Z
  - run_id: 20251019_033706_E1_seed4, seed: 4
  - lr: 0.00005, eps_decay: 100000, target_update: 300
  - artifacts_path: as above

## Notes
- E1 recipe defaults with small batch and larger step_mul to reduce runtime and fit 1h backfill window.
- Use this as a quick smoke signal; follow with seeds 6/8 or longer runs under normal QoS.
