# 20251004_013929_baseline — Experiment Run

First baseline run with reduced GPU memory settings to establish current performance.

## Overview
- Run ID: 20251004_013929_baseline
- Objective: Establish baseline win rate with memory-constrained settings
- Part: 1 = parameter-only (memory optimization)

## Config deltas (from original baseline)
List only changed parameters, with previous -> new values.
- BATCH_SIZE: 32 -> 8
- REPLAY_MEMORY_SIZE: 10000 -> 5000
- SCREEN_RESOLUTION: 64 -> 32
- MINIMAP_RESOLUTION: 64 -> 32
- NUM_EPISODES: 10000 -> 100 (short test)
- START_EPISODE: 2000 -> 0 (train from scratch)
- EPS_START: 0.95 -> 0.90
- EPS_DECAY: 10000 -> 50000
- TARGET_UPDATE_FREQ: 20 -> 100
- SEED: 42 -> 4

## Results
- 100-episode test win rate: 8.00%
- Mean/median test reward: -0.43
- Training: 100 episodes completed successfully
- Checkpoints: model_ep100.pth saved
- GPU: No OOM errors with reduced settings

## Observations
- What worked: Memory optimization successful, no CUDA OOM
- GPU memory usage: High baseline usage (23.2GB/24GB) from other processes
- NO_OP behavior: Not specifically monitored in this run
- Performance: 8% win rate is lower than expected 20% baseline, likely due to:
  - Reduced spatial resolution (64x64 -> 32x32) limiting visual information
  - Smaller batch size reducing learning stability  
  - Different random seed
  - Training from scratch vs. checkpoint

## Next steps
- Immediate follow-ups: 
  - Try higher resolution (48x48 or 64x64) if memory allows
  - Increase batch size gradually to find memory limit
  - Run longer training (1000+ episodes) for better evaluation
- Parameter sweep targets:
  - EPS_DECAY: try 20000-100000 range
  - LEARNING_RATE: try 5e-5, 1e-4, 2.5e-4
  - BATCH_SIZE: find maximum that fits in available GPU memory
  - TARGET_UPDATE_FREQ: try 50, 100, 200
