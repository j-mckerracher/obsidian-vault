## E2 TUF sweep (200 vs 400) preliminary results

### Summary of what happened
- Initiated TUF sweep under E2 (dueling enabled) with 500 episodes per seed on standby QoS.
- First set (presumed TUF=200): seeds 4/6/8 achieved 67% / 98% / 16%.
- Alternate run (presumed TUF=400) for seed 8 achieved 51% (vs. 16%), indicating TUF impacts stability/performance.

### Decisions and motivations
- Motivation: identify a target update frequency that stabilizes performance across seeds under E2 without changing other hyperparameters.
- Decision: complete missing seeds (4 and 6) at the better‑performing TUF (presumed 400) before drawing conclusions.

### Impact on subsequent steps
- Next: submit 500‑episode runs for seeds 4 and 6 at the presumed TUF=400, then aggregate across seeds.
- Progression gate: if mean ≥ 44% with acceptable variance, proceed to 1,000‑episode confirmatory runs; otherwise, consider minor E2 hyperparameter tweaks.
- Continue using standby backfill micro‑chunks for quick turnaround; keep detailed logs in Experiments.
