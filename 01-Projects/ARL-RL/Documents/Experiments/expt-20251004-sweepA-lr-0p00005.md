## Summary
This experiment was part of Sweep A, investigating the impact of a learning rate of 0.00005.

## Goal
To test the learning rate candidate (LR=0.00005) as part of Sweep A.

## Setup (Hardware/Software)
- **Environment:** Gilbreth (inferred from artifacts path)
- **Resolution:** 32x32
- **Batch Size:** 8
- **Replay Memory Size:** 50,000

## Procedure
Specific procedure details (e.g., job submission commands) are not explicitly recorded in this legacy note.

## Results
- **100-episode test win rate:** 57.0%
- **Average reward:** 1.11

## Analysis
The note provides no explicit analysis beyond the results.

## Issues
