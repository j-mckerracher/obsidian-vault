## Summary
Investigation into the effect of higher screen and minimap resolution (64x64) on agent performance using the frozen Stage E2 configuration.

## Goal
Determine if increasing resolution from 32x32 to 64x64 improves spatial awareness and win rates, particularly for tactical positioning, without requiring architectural changes.

## Setup (Hardware/Software)
- **Cluster**: Gilbreth HPC
- **Nodes**: A30 partition
- **Memory**: 80GB (increased from 50GB to handle 4x input size)
- **QoS**: Standby (to bypass group limits and accelerate scheduling)

## Procedure
1.  Submit 3 parallel jobs (seeds 4, 6, 8).
2.  Run for 500 episodes (smoke test duration).
3.  Compare 500-episode win rates against E2 32x32 baseline (approx 52%).

## Results
### Win Rates (500-episode smoke test)
- **Seed 4**: 7.0%
- **Seed 6**: 67.0%
- **Seed 8**: 9.0%
- **Mean**: 27.7%

### Comparison to 32x32 Baseline (500 eps)
- **Baseline (32x32)**: 52.7% mean (Seeds: 56%, 68%, 34%)
- **Current (64x64)**: 27.7% mean (Seeds: 7%, 67%, 9%)
- **Delta**: -25.0 pp (Significant regression)

## Analysis
- **Instability**: Increasing resolution to 64x64 caused massive instability in 2 out of 3 seeds (Seeds 4 & 8 < 10%).
- **Partial Success**: Seed 6 (67%) performed comparably to the baseline (68%), suggesting the architecture *can* learn at this resolution, but the current hyperparameters (tuned for 32x32) are brittle for the larger state space.
- **Conclusion**: The frozen E2 configuration is not robust at 64x64 resolution without further tuning or longer training times.

## Issues
- **High Variance**: Extreme performance difference between seeds.
- **Regression**: Failed to match or beat the 32x32 baseline.

## Next Steps
- **Recommendation**: **Stop** resolution scaling efforts for now to avoid "tuning rabbit holes" before handover.
- **Action**: Revert to the stable **32x32 resolution** (94.3% win rate).
- **Next Experiment**: Proceed to **Stage E4 (N-step returns)** using the stable 32x32 baseline.
