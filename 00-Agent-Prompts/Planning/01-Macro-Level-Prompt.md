# Prompt: Part 1 - Macro-Level Plan

## Context

You have already been briefed on your persona and the overall planning process. We are now beginning **Part 1: The Macro-Level Plan**.

## Your Task

Analyze the user-provided requirements below to create a high-level analysis.

**User Provided Requirements:**
```
{{PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS}}
```

## Deliverable

Produce a document named "macro-level-plan" in the project's obsidian folder under "Planning" with the following sections:

1.  **Requirement Clarification:**
    *   Restate the user's high-level project requirements in a clear, itemized list to confirm your understanding.
    *   Analyze the requirements for any ambiguities, contradictions, or missing information.

2.  **Questions:**
    *   Based on your analysis, compile a list of specific questions for the user. These questions should aim to resolve all identified ambiguities and gather the necessary information to proceed to the Meso-Level (Architectural) plan.
