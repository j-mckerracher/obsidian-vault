I'm working on a tight deadline with this project. In the event that the website can't be finished in time, I need to have a backup version ready. This backup version won't use a 3D point cloud. Where the point cloud scenes currently reside on the website, I would instead have an embedded video. To that end, I need you to:
1. analyze the notes here: /home/josh/Documents/obsidian-vault/01\ Projects/AGILE3D-Demo/Planning/main-plan
2. analyze the relevant parts of the codebase
3. write a macro level plan detailing what changes would be required to implement this backup plan.
