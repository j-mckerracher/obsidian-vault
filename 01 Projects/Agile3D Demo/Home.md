## Context & Goals
- Purpose: Create a concise, runnable demo for Pengcheng's Agile3D MobiSys 2025 paper
- Success criteria: Working demo that showcases key contributions within 20-30 hour budget

## Summary
Build an attractive and feasible demo for Pengcheng's Agile3D paper (MobiSys 25) to be featured in the NSF site visit video.

## Goals
- Reproduce key results from the Agile3D paper
- Create a compelling visual demonstration of the system
- Ensure demo runs reliably and showcases innovation
- Keep scope manageable within time budget

## Context
- Why this matters: Showcases cutting-edge mobile systems research for NSF reviewers
- Dependencies: Access to Agile3D code, datasets, and coordination with Pengcheng
- Stakeholders: Pengcheng (primary author), NSF reviewers, video production team

## Scope
- In: Core Agile3D functionality, visual demonstration, basic performance metrics
- Out: Extensive optimization, new features, comprehensive benchmarking

## Deliverables
- Working demo environment (containerized if possible)
- Demo script and walkthrough
- Sample datasets and test cases
- Visual assets for video production
- Performance metrics or results visualization

## Milestones
- [ ] Milestone 1: Environment setup and code reproduction — due: Oct 14, 2025
- [ ] Milestone 2: Demo scenario defined and working — due: Oct 21, 2025
- [ ] Milestone 3: Demo ready for video recording — due: Oct 28, 2025

## Timeline
- Time budget: 20-30 hours total
- Week 1: Environment setup and initial reproduction
- Week 2: Demo refinement and testing
- Week 3: Final preparation and coordination with video team

## Communication
- Initial meeting with Pengcheng to understand paper and codebase
- Regular updates on progress and blockers
- Coordination with NSF video production timeline

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: Complex setup or dependencies
  - Mitigation: Start with simplest working example, escalate issues quickly
- Risk: Code not readily available or documented
  - Mitigation: Direct collaboration with Pengcheng, focus on concepts if needed

## Notes
- Paper URL: https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl/publications/papers/2025/agile3d-mobisys25.pdf
- Focus on visual impact for video demonstration
- Consider mobile/edge computing aspects for compelling narrative
