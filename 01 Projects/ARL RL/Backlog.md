# Backlog — ARL RL

## High Priority
- [ ] Submit E2 production runs (2k-4k episodes per seed, seeds 4/6/8, frozen E2 config)
- [ ] Monitor and aggregate E2 production results
- [ ] Validate long-term stability and performance

## Medium Priority
- [ ] Document final E2 production results in Experiments
- [ ] Design E4 (N-step returns, n=3) experiment plan
- [ ] Consider resolution scaling test (64×64) after E2 production

## Low Priority / Future
- [ ] Revisit PER after architecture/resolution changes
- [ ] Add auto-resume from checkpoint feature
- [ ] Add deadline guard to save before SLURM timeout
- [ ] Explore multi-seed aggregation for policy ensembles
