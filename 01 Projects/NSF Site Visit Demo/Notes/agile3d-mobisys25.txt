Impact on System Design. These dependencies indicate that tun-
ing one control knob may require adjustments to others, rendering
it impractical to optimize these parameters within a single model
as is common in 2D systems. Agile3D addresses this challenge by
employing cross-model branching, with each branch optimized for
a specific set of control knob configurations. This approach enables
broad adaptability to meet diverse operational requirements.
